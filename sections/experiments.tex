We ran all the experiments using Adam optimizer with the learning rate of $10^{-4}$ and the weight decay of $5*10^{-6}$. We used Binary Cross Entropy as our primary loss function, summed up with the Contrastive Shape loss in the Contrastive Learning experiments.  We did all the preliminary experiments using 80 percent of the data to train for $3'000$ epochs and the rest for validation. In the final run, however, we used all the labeled data and trained the model for [?] epochs. All the random seeds are set to a fixed number to ensure the reproducibility of the results.
