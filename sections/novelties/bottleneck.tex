In the U-Net architecture, the downsampling at each depth is done using max-pooling.
However, if the image size is too large, the layers might miss the global information at the lowest depth.
Hence, we experiment by using global average pooling at the lowest depth.
This enforces a bottleneck that captures a single scalar for the entire image in each channel.
This is done to capture global information from the entire image irrespective of the image size.
